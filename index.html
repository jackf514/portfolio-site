                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi, I'm Jack Ferguson! Born and raised in Birmingham, Alabama, I recieved my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Clemson University. It was during my time at Clemson that I was first exposed to the world of programming via the Matlab language. The more I learned, the more I came to enjoy coding and all that I could do with it. By the time I was getting ready to graduate, I was beginning to think that I should have gone into computer science instead! But I finished my degree in Mechanical Engineering and got a job as an engineer with a company back in Birmingham. However, in my role I also got to play around with some code every now and then, mainly fixing some old, broken PHP programs. The company then decided to obtain a low-code, business automation platform called Appian and assigned me as a developer for that system. I have been developing applications for that system as a part of my job for the past two years now.<br><br>Recently I decieded to try my hand at web development and began taking a Codecademy course for full stack web development in order to find out where my interests and skills lie in the world of web development</p>

                <h2>My Learning Progress</h2>
                <p>So far I have completed a short, online course on web development, which gave me an introduction to HTML, CSS, and JS, and about 28% of the Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer course. I have a solid foundation of HTML, CSS, and JS. I have only worked with the front end side of web development so far in the course, but should be starting the back end soon.<br><br>I've especially enjoyed learning and using HTML and CSS to style web pages.</p>
